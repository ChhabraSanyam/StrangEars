# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the conversion of the StrangEars anonymous chat platform from custom CSS to Tailwind CSS. The goal is to modernize the styling approach while maintaining the exact visual appearance, animations, and responsive behavior of the current implementation. The conversion should improve maintainability, consistency, and development velocity while preserving the calming, minimalist design that supports users during emotional moments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to convert the project to use Tailwind CSS, so that I can leverage utility-first styling for better maintainability and consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Tailwind CSS is installed THEN the system SHALL include all necessary dependencies and configuration files
2. WHEN Tailwind is configured THEN the system SHALL preserve all custom fonts (Prata, Young Serif, Jomhuria, Ysabeau, Inter)
3. WHEN Tailwind is set up THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing color palette and design tokens
4. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL compile Tailwind utilities without conflicts
5. WHEN development server starts THEN the system SHALL support Tailwind's hot reload functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the visual appearance to remain identical after the Tailwind conversion, so that my experience is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the landing page loads THEN the system SHALL display identical layout, colors, and typography as the current version
2. WHEN users interact with buttons THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing hover effects and animations
3. WHEN the page is responsive THEN the system SHALL preserve all current breakpoints and mobile layouts
4. WHEN animations play THEN the system SHALL maintain identical timing, easing, and visual effects
5. WHEN users navigate THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing transitions and micro-interactions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all custom animations to work with Tailwind CSS, so that the smooth user experience is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN buttons are hovered THEN the system SHALL maintain the smooth expansion animation with delayed text change
2. WHEN the tagline appears THEN the system SHALL preserve the smooth upward movement animation
3. WHEN users scroll THEN the system SHALL maintain the hero section minimization animation
4. WHEN elements fade in THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing fade and slide animations
5. WHEN responsive breakpoints trigger THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth transitions between layouts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the component structure to remain clean and semantic, so that the code is maintainable and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting CSS classes THEN the system SHALL maintain semantic component names where appropriate
2. WHEN using Tailwind utilities THEN the system SHALL group related utilities logically for readability
3. WHEN complex styles are needed THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind's @apply directive for component-level abstractions
4. WHEN custom values are required THEN the system SHALL extend Tailwind's configuration appropriately
5. WHEN accessibility is considered THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing ARIA attributes and semantic HTML

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the responsive design to be implemented with Tailwind's responsive utilities, so that I can leverage the framework's mobile-first approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing responsive design THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
2. WHEN breakpoints are defined THEN the system SHALL match the existing custom breakpoints (768px, 480px)
3. WHEN mobile layouts are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain identical spacing, sizing, and positioning
4. WHEN tablet layouts are displayed THEN the system SHALL preserve all intermediate responsive states
5. WHEN desktop layouts are shown THEN the system SHALL maintain the full-width design and spacing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want custom design tokens to be properly configured in Tailwind, so that the design system is consistent and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN custom colors are needed THEN the system SHALL define them in the Tailwind configuration
2. WHEN custom fonts are used THEN the system SHALL configure font families in the Tailwind theme
3. WHEN custom spacing is required THEN the system SHALL extend Tailwind's spacing scale appropriately
4. WHEN custom animations are defined THEN the system SHALL configure them in the Tailwind animation system
5. WHEN custom shadows or effects are used THEN the system SHALL define them as Tailwind utilities

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to be optimized, so that the final bundle size is minimal and performance is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the production build runs THEN the system SHALL purge unused Tailwind utilities
2. WHEN CSS is generated THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve the current bundle size
3. WHEN styles are processed THEN the system SHALL optimize for critical CSS loading
4. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve current performance metrics
5. WHEN development builds run THEN the system SHALL provide fast compilation and hot reload
