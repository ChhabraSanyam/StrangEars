# Requirements Document

## Introduction

StrangEars is an anonymous one-to-one chatting platform designed to connect people who need emotional support through venting or listening. The platform provides a safe, anonymous environment where users can either share their thoughts and feelings or offer a listening ear to others. The core philosophy is "Hear. Vent. Connect." - recognizing that sometimes people need to talk, and sometimes they just need to listen.
